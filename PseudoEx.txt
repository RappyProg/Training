Write a code to display multiplication table of a given integer.
Example number 9
output should be:
- 9 x 1
- 9 x 2
....
- 9 x 10

Hint:
1. What is multiplication table?
2. Example as above
3. Convert 9 or any num as constant variable because it doesnt change and set the limit to 10 because multiplication table typically starts from 1 and end on 10
4. defined loops rule as for(i=1;i<=limit;i++){}

Solving:
1. Define num and limit. In this case:
const num = 9
const limit = 10
2. using for loop using above rules for(i=1;i<=limit;i++){}
3. inside the for loop we can define put console.log to print every iteration, resembling a multiplication table. with:
for(i=1;i<=limit;i++){
    console.log(`${num} x ${i}`)
}
4. Whole output should be in this format:
9 x i
5. We can close the loop with:
END FOR
